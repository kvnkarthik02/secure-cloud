# secure-cloud-service
My attempt at creating a secure cloud storage application which implements a key management system. which employs public-key certificates that allows users of the system to share files securely, and also allows one to add or remove users from the group.

The backend in both client and cloud (server) are coded in Express, with a simple frontend created using Svelte.
